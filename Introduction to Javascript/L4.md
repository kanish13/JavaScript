Rules to define variables in javascript:

* Variable names must start with a letter, an underscore ( _ ) or a dollar sign ( $ ).

* Variable names cannot contain spaces.

* Variables cannot be the same as reserved keywords such as if or const .

* By convention, JavaScript variable names are written in camelCase.
