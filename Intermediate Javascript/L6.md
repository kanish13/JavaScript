Fizz Buzz Problem:

Rules:

Iterate through a series of numbers, typically from 1 to a given limit.

For each number in the series:

If the number is divisible by 3 (i.e., it is a multiple of 3), print "Fizz".

If the number is divisible by 5 (i.e., it is a multiple of 5), print "Buzz".

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Otherwise, simply print the number itself.

Code:

    var a=[];
    var count=1
    function fizbuzz(){
        
        
        if (count%3===0 && count%5===0){
            a.push("FizzBuzz");
            count++;
        }
        else if(count%3===0){
                a.push("Fizz");
                count++;
            }
        else if(count%5===0){
                    a.push("Buzz");
                    count++;
                }
        else{
                    a.push(count)
                    count++;
                }
            
        
        console.log(a);
    }
