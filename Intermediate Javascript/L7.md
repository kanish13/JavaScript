Looping Statements:

while Loop:

The while loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. It repeatedly checks the condition before each iteration and stops when the condition becomes false.

Syntax:

    while (condition) {
      // Code to be executed
    }

Ex:

        var i = 0;
        while (i < 5) {
          console.log(i);
          i++;
        }

for Loop:

The for loop is another type of loop that repeats a block of code a specified number of times. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement expression.

Syntax:

    for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
      // Code to be executed
    }

Ex:

    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }
